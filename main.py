# Tetris - game logic
# I want to have a level system, each level the gamespeed increases a certain amount which affects the total score
# How many blocks can fit in the x axis? probably 6 to 8 ?

# TODO: read up on abstract classes and inheritance in python
# BLOCKS available: 7
# square, L, backward L, straight line, small T, stair, backward star

# SCORE (from wiki)
# one line rewards 100 pts, four lines rewards 800 pts (called tetris)
# each subsequent back-to-back tetris awards 1200 pts
# each level has a different score-multiplier

# UI
# HOTKEYS
# arrows keys: left / right to move that way, up to turn the block, and down for a hard-drop
# p: to pause
# r: to reset
